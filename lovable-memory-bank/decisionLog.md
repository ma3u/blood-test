## Decision

Allow BloodTestResult.value to be of type `string | number` instead of just `number`

## Rationale

1. Form inputs naturally return string values
2. Converting between types in every component creates unnecessary complexity
3. Some operations require numeric values (charts, calculations)
4. Supporting both types provides flexibility while maintaining functionality

## Implementation Details

1. Updated BloodTestResult interface in bloodTestUtils.ts to use union type `string | number`
2. Modified analyzeBloodTest function to handle string values by parsing them to float
3. Updated chart components to convert string values to numbers before calculations
4. Added type assertions in components where TypeScript couldn't infer the correct types

## Decision

Implement a compact, responsive design for blood test input form

## Rationale

1. More compact design improves user experience and fits more information on screen
2. Responsive layout adjusts to different screen sizes
3. Contextual information (hover details) reduces visual clutter while providing necessary details
4. Gender-specific reference ranges improve accuracy of test analysis

## Implementation Details

1. Moved reference values link into the gender selection box for a more compact layout
2. Show reference values in input field placeholders according to selected gender
3. Added hover information tooltips for each input field showing detailed marker information
4. Implemented responsive grid layout with multiple columns based on viewport width
5. Added gender-specific reference ranges that update when switching between male/female
6. Organized blood markers into categories for better visual grouping
7. Used HoverCard component to display detailed information about each marker

## Decision

Fixed gender switch functionality and improved UI organization

## Rationale

1. Gender switch was not properly changing the reference ranges
2. Reference ranges were displayed redundantly both in placeholder and below input fields
3. Additional information about markers was taking too much vertical space

## Implementation Details

1. Fixed gender switch component to properly pass the selected gender to parent components
2. Updated BloodTestContainer to properly handle gender changes and pass them to getStatus function
3. Moved reference range information from below input fields into the info hover cards
4. Added gender-specific reference ranges in the placeholder text of input fields
5. Enhanced HoverCard components to display comprehensive marker information including reference ranges
6. Ensured reference ranges update appropriately when gender selection changes

## Decision

Enhanced upload functionality and visual design with health impact categorization

## Rationale

1. Users need to upload documents directly within the same interface
2. Color-coding values by health impact improves user understanding
3. Information boxes provide context without cluttering the interface
4. Categorizing blood markers by health impact area creates logical grouping
5. Multi-date extraction from documents enhances the utility of OCR

## Implementation Details

1. Integrated document upload functionality directly into the main blood test form using a tab interface
2. Created a comprehensive OCR information box explaining supported document types
3. Implemented color-coded categories for different health impact areas (cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.)
4. Added a legend explaining the health categories and their significance
5. Enhanced the test date display with an information card explaining its importance
6. Created a dialog system to display and select between multiple extracted test dates
7. Added gradient buttons and improved overall color scheme for visual appeal
8. Implemented category-based organization of blood markers with appropriate colors
9. Enhanced hover cards with more detailed marker information and implications

## Decision

Fixed icon imports in BloodTestContainer component

## Rationale

1. Build errors occurred due to importing non-existent icons from lucide-react
2. Icons like 'FilePdf' and references to 'CalendarIcon' were causing build failures

## Implementation Details

1. Replaced 'FilePdf' with the standard 'File' icon from lucide-react
2. Fixed all references to 'CalendarIcon' to use the imported 'Calendar' component
3. Updated all icon usages to ensure compatibility with the lucide-react package
4. Maintained the same visual design and functionality while resolving build errors
