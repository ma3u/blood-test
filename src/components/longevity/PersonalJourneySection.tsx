      <p className="mb-4">Growing up, I watched my parents struggle with serious health issuesâ€”problems that were largely the result of unhealthy habits: smoking, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and chronic stress. Their experiences became a powerful warning for me. I saw firsthand how smoking, physical inactivity, and poor nutrition can lead to years lost from both lifespan and healthspan, and I realized that I didn't want to follow the same path. Avoiding smoking became a conscious priority in my own lifestyle changes.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">A few years ago, I faced my own health wake-up call. My cholesterol values were high, and I was teetering on the edge of being overweight. The numbers were clear: if I didn't change, I could be heading toward the same fate as my parents. But research shows that genetics account for less than 2% of mortality risk, while about 17% is shaped by modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors. That meant my future was largely in my own hands.</p>
