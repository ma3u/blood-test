**Date:** 2025-05-07 16:30:00  
**Category:** UI/UX

#### Headline
Enhanced upload functionality and visual design with health impact categorization.

#### Rationale
- Users need to upload documents directly within the same interface.
- Color-coding values by health impact improves user understanding.
- Information boxes provide context without cluttering the interface.
- Categorizing blood markers by health impact area creates logical grouping.
- Multi-date extraction from documents enhances the utility of OCR.

#### Implementation Details
- Integrated document upload functionality directly into the main blood test form using a tab interface.
- Created a comprehensive OCR information box explaining supported document types.
- Implemented color-coded categories for different health impact areas (cardiovascular, metabolic, etc.).
- Added a legend explaining the health categories and their significance.
- Enhanced the test date display with an information card explaining its importance.
- Created a dialog system to display and select between multiple extracted test dates.
- Added gradient buttons and improved overall color scheme for visual appeal.

### Decision 006: Dependency â€“ Icon Import Fixes (lucide-react)

**Date:** 2025-05-07 18:15:00  
**Category:** Dependency

#### Headline
Fix icon imports in BloodTestContainer component.

#### Rationale
- Build errors occurred due to importing non-existent icons from lucide-react.
