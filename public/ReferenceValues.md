| Biotin (Vitamin B7)              | ng/L         | >250                                            | >250                                            | Hair, skin, nails                              | Water-soluble B vitamin essential for fatty acid synthesis, glucose metabolism, and amino acid catabolism. Important for hair, skin, and nail health. Cofactor for carboxylase enzymes in energy metabolism. |
| **üî• Inflammation Markers** |  |  |  |  |  |
| CRP (C-reactive protein, hsCRP)  | mg/L         | <1.0 (optimal: <0.8)                           | <1.0 (optimal: <0.8)                            | Acute phase protein, inflammation marker       | Sensitive marker of systemic inflammation produced by the liver. Elevated in infection, tissue damage, and chronic inflammation. High-sensitivity test (hsCRP) used to assess cardiovascular risk. |
| BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) | ng/ml | 30‚Äì40 (target)                                 | 30‚Äì40 (target)                                  | Brain health, avoid <20                        | Protein that supports survival and growth of neurons. Important for neuroplasticity, learning, and memory. Levels influenced by exercise, stress, sleep quality, and inflammation. Low levels linked to depression and neurodegeneration. |
| AGEs (Advanced glycation endproducts) | ¬µg/ml   | <50 (the lower the better)                     | <50 (the lower the better)                      | Aging, metabolic health                        | Compounds formed when sugars react with proteins or lipids without enzyme control. Contribute to aging, inflammation, and tissue damage. Levels increased by high blood sugar, oxidative stress, and certain cooking methods. |
| Nitrotyrosine                    | nmol/L       | <200 (target)                                  | <200 (target)                                   | Nitrosative stress                             | Marker of protein oxidation and nitrosative stress. Forms when peroxynitrite modifies tyrosine residues in proteins. Elevated in chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases. |
| Zonulin (leaky gut marker)       | ng/ml        | <30 (the lower the better)                     | <30 (the lower the better)                      | Intestinal permeability                        | Protein that regulates tight junctions between intestinal cells. Elevated levels indicate increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"). Associated with autoimmune diseases, food sensitivities, and metabolic disorders. |

### Notes for Use:
- These values are based on the latest epigenetic and macro-molecular research from orthomolecular medicine experts
- ‚úì indicates tests paid by public health insurance
- ‚≠ê indicates tests highly recommended by modern experts
- Optimal values often differ from conventional reference ranges, reflecting functional medicine targets
- Individual needs may vary based on age, sex, genetics, lifestyle, and health conditions
- Regular monitoring of these values can help identify subclinical deficiencies before symptoms develop
- Interpretation should always consider clinical context and multiple biomarkers rather than isolated values
- Consult with healthcare providers knowledgeable in functional and orthomolecular medicine for personalized guidance
