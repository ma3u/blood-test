| Nitrotyrosine                    | nmol/L       | <200 (target)                                  | <200 (target)                                   | Nitrosative stress                             | Marker of protein oxidation and nitrosative stress. Forms when peroxynitrite modifies tyrosine residues in proteins. Elevated in chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions, and neurodegenerative diseases. |
| Zonulin (leaky gut marker)       | ng/ml        | <30 (the lower the better)                     | <30 (the lower the better)                      | Intestinal permeability                        | Protein that regulates tight junctions between intestinal cells. Elevated levels indicate increased intestinal permeability ("leaky gut"). Associated with autoimmune diseases, food sensitivities, and metabolic disorders. |

### Notes for Use:
- These values are based on the latest epigenetic and macro-molecular research from orthomolecular medicine experts
- ✓ indicates tests paid by public health insurance
- ⭐ indicates tests highly recommended by modern experts
- Optimal values often differ from conventional reference ranges, reflecting functional medicine targets
- Individual needs may vary based on age, sex, genetics, lifestyle, and health conditions
- Regular monitoring of these values can help identify subclinical deficiencies before symptoms develop
- Interpretation should always consider clinical context and multiple biomarkers rather than isolated values
- Consult with healthcare providers knowledgeable in functional and orthomolecular medicine for personalized guidance
